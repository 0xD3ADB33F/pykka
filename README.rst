Pykka
=====

Pykka implements the actor model for concurrent programming on top of the
`gevent <http://www.gevent.org/>`_ library, which again is based on greenlet
and libevent.

The goal of Pykka is to provide easy to use concurrency abstraction for Python.
And since Pykka is built on gevent, the performance should be quite all right
too.
